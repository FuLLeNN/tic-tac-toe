# Assignment 1 - Tic-Tac-Two!

## Overview

This assignment tasks you with creating two browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe games, each using a different programming paradigm. You are required to build one game using object-oriented programming (OO) and another using functional programming (FP). The games must meet specific requirements, including identical player experiences, displaying status messages, and having a restart button.

## Game Description

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a three-by-three grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the game.

## Requirements

1. **Identical Player Experience:** The two game versions must be indistinguishable to the player. Both should provide the same gameplay and features.

2. **Status Messages:** Both games must display status messages to inform the player about the current game state. These messages should indicate the next player's turn or declare the winner of the game.

3. **Restart Button:** Include a restart button in both games to allow players to start a new game at any time.

4. **Technologies:** You can only use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the games. External libraries are not allowed.

5. **Styling:** There are no specific styling requirements for the games. Focus on functionality and adherence to the assignment's technical specifications.
  
6. **File Naming:** The files handed in should be named oo.html for the object-oriented version and fun.html for the functional programming version.
